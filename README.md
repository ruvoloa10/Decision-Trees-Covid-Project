This is the final group project for my decision trees course. This consisted of finding a dataset that interested us and then used multiple decision tree techniques to find the best model. We then presented these results in a presentation. The models we tried were CHAID, Exhuastive CHAID, CART, and Logistic Regression. We then compared all of these models based on different criteria to find which model produced the best representation of the data. The final model was to predict the people most likely to have or to not have covid based on different characteristics. This analysis was done through the statistics software of SPSS.
